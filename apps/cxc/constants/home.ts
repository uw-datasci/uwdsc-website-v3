    question: "What is a Data Hackathon?",
    answer: `An event where hackers work in teams to tackle data-related challenges, such as making predictions or classifications from preprepared data sets. You will receive a data set as well as some problem statements, and you will be judged on both your technical abilities as well as the business viability of your solution. At CxC, we will also be hosting social activities, introductory workshops, company booths, and more to help you connect with other participants, industry experts, and learn more about data science.`,
